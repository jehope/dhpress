DHPress is a flexible, repurposable, fully extensible digital public humanities toolkit designed for non-technical users.  
  
== Description ==

The digital public humanities toolkit, DH Press (formerly, diPH) is built on the WordPress platform and its plugin-based architecture.

DH Press is a flexible, repurposable, fully extensible digital public humanities toolkit designed for non-technical users. It enables administrative users to build web-based community projects that combine interactive historical maps, tags, categories, metadata, and multimedia objects (including videos, web pages, images, placemarkers, and virtual walking tours). WordPressâ€™s plugin architecture allows for open and unlimited enhancement of features and functionalities.

Building DH Press on WordPress offers the following important benefits: 
	1) its CMS provides a stable and robust core, 
	2) it allows us to tap into a broad community of developers and users and to contribute new plugins to the WordPress community, and 
	3) it facilities agile development through plugin modification. 
	
Thus, building DH Press on top of the WordPress CMS results in a truly sustainable, open-source, and extensible toolkit that can be used and re-used across the globe.
