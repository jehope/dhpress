          <li data-class="icon-fullscreen" data-options="tipLocation:bottom" class="custom-class">Click the “Fullscreen map” button to switch between a smaller view of the map and one that takes up the browser’s entire window. All of the map’s interactivity is functional in both views. When in the smaller map view, you will see the rest of the project site, including the navigation bar at the top and any additional content on the sidebar.\
          </li>

          <li data-class="icon-legend" data-options="tipLocation:bottom" class="custom-class">Click on the check box or name to narrow the display of markers on the map to that category. Check multiple boxes to see markers from multiple categories at the same time.
        </li>

          <li>To reposition the map in any cardinal direction, click and hold the mouse down while moving the mouse. This will allow you to pan, or drag, the map to see areas not currently visible in the browser. Panning will not affect the zoom level of the map.</li>

          <li>Clicking on a card opens up a lightbox (or popup window) with more information about that marker. Depending on the amount of content in the lightbox, you may need to scroll down to see everything. Click the green link button (when enabled) at the bottom to open up a new tab in the browser. This allows you either to navigate to more information about the selected marker, or to a page of related markers. </li>

          <li>Firefox and Chrome are the recommended browsers for DH Press. Some users may experience difficulty viewing all of a project’s features in their browser, particularly those using ad blockers and other browser plugins. Mac users experiencing problems with Flash should use Safari. </li>
